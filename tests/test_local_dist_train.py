"""
test_local_dist_train.py

This script tests distributed machine learning using Tensorlink's P2P network using local nodes on different
processes. It simulates a local environment with a user, worker, and validator node collaborating to train a
simple model.

Overview:
---------
1. **Node Initialization**:
   - Launches `UserNode`, `WorkerNode`, and `ValidatorNode` to simulate distributed roles.
   - `UserNode`: Manages job coordination, should be spawned in the main train or inference script.
   - `WorkerNode`: Handles data processing, can be run on local group of computers and bootstrapped to a validator
    manually, as done in this example, or through the tensorlink-miner to donate public compute.
   - `ValidatorNode`: Validates and approves tasks, coordinates resources and connections between worker and user node.
    Mainly ensures operation of the public P2P net, but is still required for local jobs.

2. **Node Connectivity**:
   - Establishes P2P connections among nodes (this process is only required for connecting local or a closed
   group of devices, network bootstrapping is handled automatically for public jobs).
   - Simulates job request through a validator and coordinates the worker with the user to create the distributed model.

3. **Model and Training**:
   - Uses `BertForSequenceClassification` for testing distributed training.
   - Demonstrates model distribution, gradient updates, and optimization across nodes.
